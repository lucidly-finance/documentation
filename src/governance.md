# Governance

Lucidly finance is focused on building a decentralised protocol with a novel governance mechanism to provide efficient decision-making for the stakeholders of Lucidly Finance. 

### LUCID

LUCID will be the core token of the protocol, handling all the proposals at governance level(LIPs).

Although most of the protocol activites require minimal governance, these are the areas that will fall under governance:

- Whitelisting of assets for collateral
- Updating interest fee constants
- Whitelisting of gauges

Holders of LUCID buy bonds in a olympusdao mechanism. We'll be using [Bond Protocol](https://bondprotocol.finance/) to facilitate protocol owned liquidity.

Bonded LUCID or bLUCID is used to vote on gauges and protocol governance.
